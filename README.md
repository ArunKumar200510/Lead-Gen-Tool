# Benchmark Results with Intel¬Æ oneAPI Toolkits

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df0bb37a-aa31-47bd-b56b-754915d2e87d)

1. **Model Optimization**:
   - The **Intel Neural Compressor**: This component is used to quantize the phi-2 model, which means converting a model to a more efficient format that uses less memory and increases inference speed without sacrificing accuracy. It supports both static quantization and static smooth quantization for more advanced performance improvements.
   
2. **Inference**:
   - The optimized model is passed to the **IPEX backend** for inference. The Intel¬Æ Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) backend further improves inference time by integrating the quantized model into Intel architectures.
   - **FP32 format**: This format represents the 32-bit floating point precision, indicating the model is optimized for high-precision, accurate inference.

3. **Intel OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ Toolkit**: Further optimizes the inference of the model after compression. The OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ toolkit supports deep learning inference across Intel CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators to speed up model predictions.

4. **Intel Distribution for Modin**: Finally, the large datasets involved in this machine learning pipeline are managed using Intel's Modin distribution, which accelerates data processing, retrieval, and insertion tasks. It shows the efficient handling of large datasets that are crucial for AI model training and inference, enabling faster analysis with Pandas-compatible APIs.
